        "question": "What should I do if my eyes feel dry after working on a computer for a long time?",
        "reference_answer": "If your eyes feel dry after long periods of computer use, take frequent breaks and consciously blink more often to keep your eyes moist. Using artificial tears can provide temporary relief and protect the cornea from irritation. Adjust your screen brightness, contrast, and position to reduce strain, and follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Maintain proper posture and ensure adequate ambient lighting. Drinking enough water and reducing air-conditioning exposure can also help prevent dryness over time.",

        "question": "How often should I get an eye check-up?",
        "reference_answer": "Most people should have a comprehensive eye exam every one to two years, but individuals with conditions such as diabetes, high myopia, or family history of glaucoma may need more frequent exams. Regular eye check-ups help detect early signs of cataracts, retinal changes, or macular degeneration. During an exam, vision acuity, intraocular pressure, and retinal health are typically assessed. Timely detection allows interventions before significant vision loss occurs. Maintaining a regular eye exam schedule is key to long-term eye health.",

        "question": "Can wearing glasses prevent my eyesight from getting worse?",
        "reference_answer": "Glasses help correct your current vision and reduce eye strain, but they do not prevent natural changes in eyesight over time. They improve clarity for daily tasks and protect against fatigue but cannot halt progression of myopia or hyperopia. Regular eye exams are essential to monitor changes and update prescriptions as needed. Healthy visual habits, such as reducing screen time, proper lighting, and outdoor activities, support long-term eye health. Using glasses in combination with these habits can maintain comfort and prevent worsening eye fatigue.",

        "question": "What are the signs of cataracts?",
        "reference_answer": "Cataracts usually develop gradually, causing cloudy or blurry vision and difficulty seeing fine details. Increased sensitivity to light, glare at night, or colors appearing faded are common symptoms. Some individuals may experience double vision or frequent changes in their glasses prescription. Early detection through regular eye exams allows for monitoring and timely intervention. Cataract surgery may be recommended when vision significantly affects daily life. Maintaining eye health and protecting eyes from UV light can help slow progression.",

        "reference_answer": "To reduce eye strain while reading, ensure your environment has adequate lighting and avoid glare from lamps or screens. Take breaks every 20–30 minutes and look at distant objects to relax your eye muscles. Adjust text size or screen settings to improve comfort and maintain a proper reading distance. Using lubricating eye drops can help with dryness during extended reading sessions. Maintaining ergonomic posture and minimizing continuous reading or screen time can prevent long-term eye fatigue.",

        "reference_answer": "If dust enters your eye, avoid rubbing it as this can scratch the cornea. Gently rinse your eye with clean water or saline solution to remove the particle. Blinking several times can help flush out remaining debris. If irritation, redness, or pain persists, seek professional evaluation from an ophthalmologist. Prompt care reduces the risk of infection and corneal injury.",
